# ctd configuration file example

# Global configuration
main:
    # CSV file with tag to id mappings. The file must use comma (,) as
    # field separator and the first row must be a header row with the fields:
    # "tag,id".
    #
    # tag is a number between 0 and 1000. id is a string that should be used as
    # id when the tag is present.
    #
    # The file will be re-read when updated and must be updated atomically, i.e.
    # being moved into place, not copied.
    #
    # Example file (first row is the header row):
    #    tag,id
    #    123,id_one
    #    2343,od_001
    #    3421,Nice_id_34
    #
    # Optional.

    # Enable the build in REST server by specifying a list of address/port
    # combinations the server should bind to. One bind object can have the
    # following keys:
    #
    #   - addr: <IP-address> (IPv6 address must be enclosed with [])
    #     port: <port>
    #     https: yes/no
    #     cert: <path_to_pem_file_with_cert>
    #     key: <path_to_pem_file_with_key>
    #
    # If binding to a IPv6 link local address, the zone (or scope) id must be
    # added as well, e.g. [fe80::48eb:1208:3ed:5d8a%eth0] if the interface
    # in question is eth0.
    #
    # To use https, support for openssl must be compiled in.

# Logging configuration. Multiple log outputs can be configured simultaneously,

    #   'info'     - Log critiacl, error, warning and info messages
    #   'debug'    - Log critical, error, warning, info and debug messages

    # in that case override the level set here.
